### Deploy an ECS Instance with 2 EIPs and 2 ENIs, and Run a Docker Image Using the SDK

In this deployment, we set up an Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance on Alibaba Cloud with 2 Elastic IPs (EIPs) and 2 Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). We use the Alibaba Cloud SDK to automate the creation and configuration of these resources. As a prerequisite, you must create an Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR) to store a Docker image. This image will be pulled and run on the ECS instance.

### Prerequisites

1. **Alibaba Cloud Account**:
   - Ensure you have an Alibaba Cloud account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.

2. **SDK Installation on Local Machine**:
    - Install the Alibaba Cloud Python SDK:
        ```sh
        pip install aliyun-python-sdk-core
        pip install aliyun-python-sdk-ecs
        pip install aliyun-python-sdk-vpc
        ```

3. **Access Keys**:
    - Obtain your Access Key ID and Secret from the Alibaba Cloud console.

4. **Container Registry Setup**:
    - Go to the Alibaba Cloud Console.
    - Navigate to the **Container Registry** service.
    - Create a new personal Container Registry instance (no need for enterprise edition).
    - Create a new repository within your ACR instance. Note down the repository name, namespace and password (need for creating the password for access to ACR).

5. **Docker**:
    - Ensure Docker is installed on your local machine and the ECS instance (done after logging in to ECS).

6. **Python Environment**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your local machine.

Make sure all prerequisites are met before proceeding with the setup and deployment steps.

### Step 1: Running the Script (Local Machine)

1. **Create `config.json` on your local machine**:
   - Ensure the `config.json` file is beeing stored in the same directory as the script `create_ecs_instance.py`. Adjust the values to match your Alibaba Cloud account details:
     ```json
     {
       "access_key_id": "your-access-key-id",
       "access_key_secret": "your-access-key-secret",
       "region_id": "eu-central-1",
       "vpc_id": "your-vpc-id",
       "security_group_id": "your-security-group-id",
       "vswitch_id": "your-vswitch-id"
     }
     ```

2. **Download the Script**:
   - Save the Python script `create_ecs_instance.py` to your local machine and in the same folder as `config.json`.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script in your terminal:
     ```sh
     python create_ecs_instance.py
     ```

4. **Monitor Output**:
   - The script will output the progress of each step, including creating the ECS instance, attaching ENIs, allocating EIPs, and associating the EIPs with the instance and ENIs.

This sequence ensures that your ECS instance is set up with 2 EIPs and 2 network interfaces: EIP_1 is attached to ENI_1 (eth0), and EIP_2 is attached to ENI_2 (eth1).

### Step 2: Push the Docker Image to ACR (Local Machine)

1. **Log in to ACR from Your Local Machine**:
   - Log in to your ACR instance using the Docker CLI:
     ```sh
     docker login --username=your-username@your-alibaba-cloud-id registry-intl.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com
     ```
   - Replace `your-username@your-alibaba-cloud-id` with your Alibaba Cloud account username and `registry-intl.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com` with your ACR registry endpoint.

2. **Push the Docker Image to ACR**:
   - Push the tagged image to your ACR repository:
     ```sh
     docker push registry-intl.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest
     ```

### Step 3: Pull the Docker Image on ECS (ECS Instance)

1. **Log in to ECS Instance**:
   - Log in to your ECS instance using the e.g., Alibaba Cloud console's Terminal Connect feature with temporary credentials.

2. **Install Docker on ECS**:
   - Docker is automatically installed on your ECS instance due to teh usage of a user data script.

3. **Log in to ACR from ECS Instance**:
   - Log in to your ACR instance from the ECS instance using the Docker CLI (use password associated with pre-created ACR):
     ```sh
     sudo docker login --username=your-username@your-alibaba-cloud-id registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com
     ```

4. **Pull the Docker Image from ACR**:
   - Pull the Docker image from your ACR repository to the ECS instance:
     ```sh
     sudo docker pull registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest
     ```

### Step 4. Run the Pulled Docker Image on the ECS Instance (ECS Instance)

To run the Docker image you've pulled on your ECS instance, you can choose from two different configurations depending on your needs:

1. **For Testing and Basic Usage**:
   - If you're just testing an image or need a basic setup, you can run a simple Docker command without the extensive flags. This command runs the Docker container in interactive mode with a basic terminal shell (e.g. if you test the setup with the prev. mentioned `nginx:latest` image):
     ```sh
     sudo docker run -it --rm registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest /bin/bash
     ```
   Replace `registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest` with the appropriate image name and tag.

2. **For the Specific POC with Enhanced Configuration**:
   - For the specific image in question that requires multiple configurations and bindings, use the following command (or adjust it). This setup includes temporary filesystems, privileged mode, and volume bindings:
     ```sh
     sudo docker run --network host --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /mnt -v redis_vol:/var/lib/redis -v etc_vol:/etc --privileged --rm -it registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest /bin/bash
     ```

   Here, the `--network host` flag allows the container to share the host's networking namespace, `--tmpfs` creates temporary file storage in RAM, and `-v` binds volumes for persistent data storage. The `--privileged` flag gives the container extended permissions, which might be necessary for certain applications or tests.

   Replace `registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest` with your specific Docker image path and tag.

### Step 5: Verify the Setup (ECS Instance, Local Machine)

1. **Check Docker Container Status (ECS Instance)**:
    - Verify that the Docker container is running:
      ```sh
      sudo docker ps
      ```
    - You should see an output similar to this, indicating that the Nginx container is running (in case of `nginx:latest`):
      ```sh
      CONTAINER ID      IMAGE                                                                                COMMAND                  CREATED                STATUS                PORTS                                                  NAMES
      <container_id>    registry-intl-vpc.eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/your-repository:latest    "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   <time_since_created>   Up <time_since_up>    your-internal-ip-eth0->80/tcp, ...                     mynginx
      ```

2. **Access the Running Nginx Servers (Local Machine)(in case of `nginx:latest`)**:
    - Use the public static IPv4 addresses (EIPs) associated with the ECS instance to access the running Nginx server (both are visible in the Alibaba Cloud console ECS section).
    - Open a web browser and navigate to the public IPv4 addresses:
      ```
      http://<Primary_EIP>
      http://<Secondary_EIP>
      ```
    - You should see the Nginx welcome page indicating that the Nginx server is running successfully for both EIPs.

This sequence ensures that you have the image correctly tagged and pushed to ACR, and then pulled and run on your ECS instance. The setup is verified with each EIP bound to different ports, confirming that the configuration is working correctly.
